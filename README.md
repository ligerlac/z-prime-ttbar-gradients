# Differentiable Z' → tt̄ Analysis Framework

This project is a framework for High-Energy Physics (HEP) analysis that leverages automatic differentiation to optimise analysis selections for maximal statistical significance. It is built on top of the scientific Python ecosystem, including `coffea`, `awkward-array`, and `uproot` for data handling, and `JAX` for gradient-based optimisation.

The example analysis implemented here searches for a Z' boson decaying to a top-antitop quark pair (tt̄).

## Quick Start

This section guides you through running the default analysis configuration provided in the repository.

### 1. Prerequisites

#### Environment Setup

Before running, you must set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies. The recommended method is to use Pixi.

**Option 1: Interactive Development with JupyterLab**
```bash
# Install Pixi if you haven't already
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Launch JupyterLab with the full environment activated
pixi run start
```

**Option 2: Command-line Environment (Recommended for Analysis)**
```bash
# Activate a conda-like shell environment
source pixi_activate.sh
```

The `pixi_activate.sh` script provides a traditional conda-like experience, activating the environment described in `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock` for your current shell session. This is the recommended approach for running the analysis from the command line.

#### Data Preparation

The analysis workflow includes metadata generation and data skimming steps. The metadata generation uses coffea's preprocessing tools to extract work-items (file chunks with entry ranges and metadata) from your dataset files. These work-items are then processed during skimming to apply event selections and create filtered output files.

```bash
# Full workflow: generate metadata, skim data, and run analysis (default)
python analysis.py

# Only generate metadata and skim data (no analysis)
python analysis.py general.analysis=skip

# Use existing metadata and skimmed files for analysis
python analysis.py general.run_metadata_generation=False general.run_skimming=False

# Generate fresh metadata but use existing skimmed files
python analysis.py general.run_skimming=False
```


After the first run, you can set `general.run_metadata_generation=False` to read from existing metadata files, and `general.run_skimming=False` to use existing skimmed data, significantly speeding up subsequent runs.

### 2. Run the Differentiable Analysis

Once the skimmed data is available, you can run the main analysis with a single command:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

### 3. What is Happening?

The default configuration (`user/configuration.py`) is set up to perform a differentiable analysis. The command above will:
1.  **Output Directory Setup**: The framework creates a centralized `OutputDirectoryManager` that handles all output paths with proper fallback logic for metadata and skimmed files. This ensures consistent directory organization across all analysis components.
2.  **Metadata Generation**: First, it uses coffea's preprocessing tools to extract work-items from your dataset listing files, creating JSON metadata files with file paths, entry ranges, and event counts.
3.  **Data Skimming**: It processes the work-items in parallel using `dask.bag`, applying your skimming selection to filter events and create output ROOT files organised by dataset.
4.  **MVA Pre-training**: If enabled, it trains a small, JAX-based neural network to distinguish between `W+jets` and `ttbar` background events. The trained model parameters are saved to disk.
5.  **Differentiable Optimisation**: It then runs the main analysis optimisation loop. The goal is to find the selection cuts that maximise the statistical significance of the Z' signal. At each step, it calculates the gradient of the significance with respect to the cut thresholds (e.g., `met_threshold`, `btag_threshold`) and uses the `optax` optimiser to update them.
6.  **Outputs**: The analysis will produce plots in the configured output directories showing the evolution of the parameters and significance during optimisation, along with the final histograms. The final optimised significance will be printed to the console.

## For Users: What You Need to Know

**This framework separates user-configurable code from framework code:**

- **`user/` directory**: **This is where you make changes for your analysis**
  - `user/configuration.py`: Main configuration file - modify this for your analysis settings
  - `user/cuts.py`: Selection functions - define your analysis regions and cuts here
  - `user/observables.py`: Physics observables - define what variables you want to compute
  - `user/systematics.py`: Systematic variations - define uncertainty sources

- **`analysis/` and `utils/` directories**: **Framework code - you typically don't need to modify these**
  - These contain the analysis infrastructure, plotting utilities, and technical implementation

**To adapt this framework for your analysis, focus on modifying the files in the `user/` directory.** The framework will handle the rest automatically.

## Core Concepts

The central idea is to treat the entire analysis chain—from event selection to statistical significance—as a single, differentiable function. The inputs to this function are not just the data, but also the analysis parameters themselves (e.g., selection cut thresholds). By calculating the gradient of the significance with respect to these parameters, we can use optimizers like `optax` to iteratively update them and find the optimal set of cuts.

### Key Technologies
*   **`coffea` & `awkward-array`**: For handling complex, jagged data structures typical in HEP.
*   **`JAX`**: For just-in-time (JIT) compilation and automatic differentiation of Python/NumPy code.
*   **`relaxed`**: A JAX-based library for differentiable statistical models, providing a differentiable approximation of the profile likelihood ratio.
*   **`optax`**: A library of gradient-based optimizers for JAX.

### The Differentiable Workflow

The analysis is orchestrated by the `DifferentiableAnalysis` class in `analysis/diff.py`, which receives an `OutputDirectoryManager` instance to handle all file I/O operations. The workflow proceeds as follows:

1.  **Output Directory Setup**: The `OutputDirectoryManager` is initialized with user-specified or default paths, creating necessary directories and validating existing ones.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Raw NanoAOD files are skimmed to keep only necessary branches and apply a baseline selection. This is a one-time, non-differentiable step to reduce data volume.
3.  **MVA Pre-training (Optional)**: If configured, a Machine Learning model (e.g., a neural network) is trained on pre-selected data to serve as a powerful discriminator. The weights of this model can themselves become optimizable parameters.
4.  **Event Processing**: For each event, object corrections and systematic variations are applied.
5.  **Differentiable Histogramming**: Instead of making hard cuts, we apply "soft" selections using sigmoid functions. This results in a per-event weight. Histograms are filled using a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approach, which is smooth and differentiable.
6.  **Statistical Significance**: The `relaxed` library is used to construct a statistical model from the histograms and compute an asymptotic significance (a differentiable quantity).
7.  **Gradient Calculation**: `JAX` computes the gradient of the significance with respect to all optimizable parameters (cut thresholds, MVA weights, etc.).
8.  **Parameter optimisation**: The `optax` optimizer takes a step in the direction of the gradient to update the parameters, aiming to maximize significance. Steps 5-8 are repeated for a set number of iterations.
9.  **Output Generation**: Results, plots, and models are saved using the `OutputDirectoryManager` to ensure consistent organization.

## How to Implement an Analysis

Implementing a new analysis or modifying the existing one primarily involves three steps:
1.  Modifying the central configuration file.
2.  Defining the analysis logic (observables and selections) in Python functions.
3.  Running the analysis workflow.

### 1. The Configuration File (`user/configuration.py`)

This file is the central hub for defining your entire analysis. The `config` dictionary controls every aspect of the workflow.

**Key Sections:**

*   `general`: Global settings like integrated luminosity, which analysis steps to run (`run_preprocessing`, `run_mva_training`), and file paths.
*   `preprocess`: Defines the branches to keep from the input NanoAOD files.
*   `good_object_masks`: Defines baseline "good" object criteria (e.g., muon pT > 55 GeV) that are applied before any channel-specific logic. This is useful for creating a common object collection for all analysis channels.
*   `baseline_selection`: A hard, non-differentiable selection applied to all events early on.
*   `channels`: Defines the different analysis regions (e.g., signal region, control regions). For each channel, you specify:
    *   `name`: A unique name for the channel.
    *   `selection`: The selection function to apply for this channel.
    *   `observables`: A list of variables to be histogrammed.
    *   `fit_observable`: The specific observable used for the final statistical fit.
*   `ghost_observables`: A powerful feature for computing derived quantities (e.g., ST, ΔR) once and attaching them to the event record. These can then be used by any downstream function.
*   `corrections` & `systematics`: Define object and event-level corrections and systematic uncertainties. The framework supports both `correctionlib` and custom Python functions.
*   `mva`: Configure MVA models. You can define the architecture, features, and training parameters for a JAX or TensorFlow/Keras network.
*   `jax`: **This is the core of the differentiable analysis.**
    *   `params`: A dictionary of all optimizable parameters and their initial values (e.g., `'met_threshold': 50.0`).
    *   `soft_selection`: Points to the Python function that implements your differentiable selection logic.
    *   `param_updates`: Defines clamping functions to keep parameters within physical bounds during optimisation (e.g., `jnp.clip(x + d, 0.0, 3.0)`).
    *   `learning_rates`: Allows you to set custom learning rates for different parameters.

### 2. Defining Analysis Logic

The `config` file points to Python functions that contain the actual physics logic. These typically live in `user/`.

#### Observables (`user/observables.py`)

An observable function takes `awkward-array` collections as input and returns a flat array of the computed values.

**Example: `get_mtt`**
```python
def get_mtt(
    muons: ak.Array,
    jets: ak.Array,
    fatjets: ak.Array,
    met: ak.Array,
) -> ak.Array:
    # ... logic to calculate four-vectors and sum them ...
    p4tot = p4mu + p4fj + p4j + p4met
    return p4tot.mass
```

#### Selections (`user/cuts.py`)

There are two types of selection functions:

1.  **Standard Selections**: Used for non-differentiable analysis or initial hard cuts. They take `awkward` arrays and should return a `coffea.analysis_tools.PackedSelection` object.

2.  **Differentiable "Soft" Selections**: This is where the magic happens. Instead of returning a boolean mask, this function returns a continuous, per-event **weight** between 0 and 1. This is achieved by replacing hard cuts like `met.pt > 50` with a sigmoid function `jax.nn.sigmoid((met.pt - 50) / scale)`.

**Example: `Zprime_softcuts_jax_workshop`**

This function takes JAX-backed awkward arrays and a `params` dictionary (containing the optimizable parameters defined in the config).

```python
def Zprime_softcuts_jax_workshop(
    muons: ak.Array,
    jets: ak.Array,
    met: ak.Array,
    jet_mass: ak.Array,
    nn,
    params: dict
) -> jnp.ndarray:
    # ...

    # A differentiable cut on MET
    met_cut_weight = jax.nn.sigmoid(
        (ak.to_jax(met) - params["met_threshold"]) / 25.0
    )

    # A differentiable cut on a b-tagging score
    btag_cut_weight = jax.nn.sigmoid(
        (soft_b_counts - params["btag_threshold"]) * 10.0
    )

    # ... other cuts

    # Combine all weights multiplicatively (like a logical AND)
    selection_weight = jnp.prod(jnp.stack([met_cut_weight, btag_cut_weight, ...]))
    return selection_weight
```

### 3. Running the Analysis

With the configuration and functions in place, you can run the analysis using a top-level script.

#### Example `analysis.py` workflow
The main analysis script orchestrates the complete workflow:
1.  Load the base configuration from `user/configuration.py`.
2.  Optionally, override configuration settings from the command line.
3.  Generate metadata and work-items from dataset listings.
4.  Process work-items through skimming (if enabled).
5.  Run the requested analysis (differentiable, non-differentiable, or both).

```python
# In analysis.py (simplified)
import sys
from analysis.diff import DifferentiableAnalysis
from analysis.nondiff import NonDiffAnalysis
from user.configuration import config
from utils.schema import Config, load_config_with_restricted_cli
from utils.datasets import ConfigurableDatasetManager
from utils.metadata_extractor import NanoAODMetadataGenerator
from utils.skimming import process_workitems_with_skimming
from utils.output_manager import OutputDirectoryManager

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load and validate configuration
    cli_args = sys.argv[1:]
    full_config = load_config_with_restricted_cli(config, cli_args)
    config_obj = Config(**full_config)

    # Create centralized output directory manager
    output_manager = OutputDirectoryManager(
        root_output_dir=config_obj.general.output_dir,
        cache_dir=config_obj.general.cache_dir,
        metadata_dir=config_obj.general.metadata_dir,
        skimmed_dir=config_obj.general.skimmed_dir
    )

    # Initialize dataset manager and metadata generator
    dataset_manager = ConfigurableDatasetManager(config_obj.datasets)
    metadata_generator = NanoAODMetadataGenerator(
        dataset_manager=dataset_manager,
        output_manager=output_manager
    )

    # Process data and run analysis
    processed_datasets = process_workitems_with_skimming(
        workitems, config_obj, output_manager, fileset, nanoaods_summary
    )

    # Run analysis with output manager
    if config_obj.general.analysis == "diff":
        analysis = DifferentiableAnalysis(config_obj, processed_datasets, output_manager)
    else:
        analysis = NonDiffAnalysis(config_obj, processed_datasets, output_manager)
    cli_args = sys.argv[1:]
    full_config = load_config_with_restricted_cli(config, cli_args)
    config = Config(**full_config)

    # Set up dataset management
    dataset_manager = ConfigurableDatasetManager(config.datasets)

    # Generate metadata and work-items
    generator = NanoAODMetadataGenerator(dataset_manager=dataset_manager)
    generator.run(generate_metadata=config.general.run_metadata_generation)

    # Process work-items with skimming
    processed_datasets = process_workitems_with_skimming(
        generator.workitems, config, generator.fileset, generator.nanoaods_summary
    )

    # Run analysis based on mode
    if config.general.analysis == "diff":
        analysis = DifferentiableAnalysis(config, processed_datasets)
        analysis.run_analysis_optimisation()
    elif config.general.analysis == "nondiff":
        analysis = NonDiffAnalysis(config, processed_datasets)
        analysis.run_analysis_chain()
```

#### Overriding Configuration from the Command Line

You can override certain configuration options directly from the command line using a dot-list format. This is useful for quick tests and batch submissions without modifying the main configuration file.

**Example:**
```python
python analysis.py general.max_files=10 general.run_systematics=False
```

**Important Limitations:**
For safety and to prevent breaking the analysis logic, only a restricted set of configuration keys can be overridden from the command line. This is because the main Python configuration file contains complex objects like functions and lambdas, which cannot be expressed as simple command-line arguments.

The allowed top-level keys for CLI overrides are:
*   `general`
*   `preprocess`
*   `statistics`

Attempting to override other keys (e.g., `jax.params`) will result in an error. To change these, you must edit the `user/configuration.py` file directly.

## Skimming Integration

The framework provides an integrated skimming system that handles data preprocessing before analysis using a work-item-based approach.

### Dataset Configuration

The dataset manager expects text files containing lists of ROOT file paths. Configure datasets in `user/skim.py`:

```python
# user/skim.py
datasets_config = [
    {
        "name": "signal",
        "directory": "datasets/signal/m2000_w20/",  # Directory containing .txt files
        "cross_section": 1.0,
        "file_pattern": "*.txt",  # Pattern to match listing files
        "tree_name": "Events",
        "weight_branch": "genWeight"
    },
    {
        "name": "ttbar_semilep",
        "directory": "datasets/ttbar_semilep/",
        "cross_section": 831.76 * 0.438,
        "file_pattern": "*.txt",
        "tree_name": "Events",
        "weight_branch": "genWeight"
    },
    # ... other datasets
]

dataset_manager_config = {
    "datasets": datasets_config,
    "max_files": None  # No limit by default
}
```

Each dataset directory should contain `.txt` files where each line is a path to a ROOT file.

### Skimming Configuration

Define your skimming selection function and configure it:

```python
# user/skim.py
def default_skim_selection(muons, puppimet, hlt):
    """Default skimming selection function."""
    selection = PackedSelection()

    selection.add("trigger", hlt.TkMu50)
    selection.add("met_cut", puppimet.pt > 50)
    selection.add("skim", selection.all("trigger", "met_cut"))

    return selection

skimming_config = {
    "selection_function": default_skim_selection,
    "selection_use": [("Muon", None), ("PuppiMET", None), ("HLT", None)],
    "chunk_size": 100_000,
    "tree_name": "Events",
}
```

### Integration

Connect the configurations in `user/configuration.py`:

```python
# user/configuration.py
from user.skim import dataset_manager_config, skimming_config

config = {
    "general": {
        "output_dir": "example/outputs/",  # Root directory for all outputs
        # Optional: specify existing directories to read from
        # "metadata_dir": "/path/to/existing/metadata/",
        # "skimmed_dir": "/path/to/existing/skimmed/",
        "run_skimming": True,  # Enabled by default
        "run_metadata_generation": True,
    },
    "preprocess": {
        "branches": {
            "Muon": ["pt", "eta", "phi", "mass", "tightId"],
            "Jet": ["pt", "eta", "phi", "mass", "btagDeepB"],
            "PuppiMET": ["pt", "phi"],
            "HLT": ["TkMu50"],
            # ... other branches
        },
        "skimming": skimming_config
    },
    "datasets": dataset_manager_config,
    # ... rest of configuration
}
```

### Running

```bash
# Full workflow (default): metadata generation, skimming, and analysis
python analysis.py

# Skim only (no analysis)
python analysis.py general.analysis=skip

# Use existing metadata and skimmed files
python analysis.py general.run_metadata_generation=False general.run_skimming=False
```

The framework automatically:
- Generates metadata using coffea's preprocessing tools to create work-items
- Processes work-items in parallel using dask.bag for robust failure handling
- Creates output directories following the pattern `{output_dir}/skimmed/{dataset}/file__{idx}/part_{chunk}.root`
- Merges and caches events from multiple output files per dataset for efficient analysis

---

## Configuration Reference

The analysis is controlled by a central configuration dictionary, typically defined in `user/configuration.py`.
The structure of this configuration is validated against a Pydantic schema in `utils/schema.py`.

### Output Directory Management

The framework uses a centralized `OutputDirectoryManager` to handle all output paths consistently. This manager provides:

- **Centralized path management**: All output directories are managed through a single interface
- **Fallback logic**: Automatic fallback to standard locations when user-specified paths are not provided
- **Path normalization**: Proper handling of user home directory (`~`) expansion and absolute path resolution
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Uses system temporary directories instead of hardcoded paths

**Key configuration options in the `general` block:**
- `output_dir`: Root directory for all analysis outputs (default: `"output/"`)
- `cache_dir`: Cache directory for temporary files (default: uses system temp directory with `"graep"` subdirectory)
- `metadata_dir`: Directory for metadata JSON files (default: `output_dir/metadata/`)
- `skimmed_dir`: Directory for skimmed ROOT files (default: `output_dir/skimmed/`)

The manager automatically creates directories as needed and validates user-specified paths to ensure they exist and are directories.

Below is a comprehensive reference for all available options, grouped by their top-level key.

## Under the Hood: The Differentiable Engine

The core of the differentiable workflow is the `_run_traced_analysis_chain` method in `analysis/diff.py`. This function is what `JAX` traces and differentiates.

```python
def _run_traced_analysis_chain(
    self,
    params: dict[str, Any],
    processed_data_events: dict,
) -> tuple[jnp.ndarray, dict[str, Any]]:
    # ...
    # 1. Collect histograms for all processes using the current `params`
    histograms_by_process = self._collect_histograms(...)

    # 2. Calculate significance from these histograms
    significance, mle_params = self._calculate_significance(histograms_by_process, params["fit"])
    # ...
    return significance, mle_params
```

The optimisation loop in `run_analysis_optimisation` then does the following:

```python
# Define the objective function to be *maximized* (significance)
# Note: Optimizers typically *minimize*, so we would differentiate the *negative* significance.
# The `relaxed` library handles this internally.
def objective(params):
    return self._run_traced_analysis_chain(params, processed_data)

# Get the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. the parameters
gradients = jax.grad(objective)(all_parameters)

# Use an optimizer to update the parameters
# solver = OptaxSolver(fun=objective, opt=tx, ...)
# new_parameters, state = solver.update(parameters, state)
```

This loop continues until the significance converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## The Differentiable Statistical Model in JAX

A key innovation of this framework is its end-to-end differentiable statistical model. This model is constructed in JAX, allowing the entire analysis—from event selection to statistical inference—to be differentiated.

### 1. Differentiable Histograms

Instead of standard histograms with hard bin counts, the analysis produces "soft" histograms using a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approach. For each event, instead of adding `1` to a single bin, a Gaussian kernel is placed at the event's observable value. The histogram's bin contents are then the integral of all event kernels over that bin's range. This process is smooth and differentiable with respect to both the event weights (from soft selections) and the observable values themselves.

### 2. Building the Statistical Model

The statistical model is built upon these differentiable histograms. The goal is to construct a likelihood function `L(data | params)` that can be maximized to find the best-fit parameters.

The core of the model is the prediction for the expected number of events (`expected_yields`) in each histogram bin for each analysis channel. This is a function of the model parameters. In the current implementation (`utils/jax_stats.py`), the model is simplified and includes two global scalar parameters:
*   `mu` ($\mu$): The signal strength parameter. $\mu=0$ corresponds to the background-only hypothesis, and $\mu=1$ corresponds to the nominal signal hypothesis.
*   `norm_ttbar_semilep` ($\kappa_{t\bar{t}}$): A normalisation factor for the `ttbar_semilep` background process, applied uniformly across all channels.

For a single channel, the expected yield $\lambda_i$ in bin $i$ is the sum of all signal and background processes:

$\lambda_i(\mu, \kappa_{t\bar{t}}) = \mu \cdot \lambda_{\text{sig}, i} + \kappa_{t\bar{t}} \cdot \lambda_{t\bar{t}, i} + \sum_{b \in \text{other bkg}} \lambda_{b, i}$

Note that in this simplified model, systematic uncertainties are not incorporated via nuisance parameters in the differentiable fit. The framework can produce systematically-varied histograms, but they are used in the non-differentiable analysis path.

### 3. Likelihood and Hypothesis Testing with `relaxed`

With the model for `expected_yields` defined, the final step is to perform statistical inference. This is where the `relaxed` library is used.

1.  **Likelihood Construction**: `relaxed` takes the JAX model of expected yields and the observed data histograms to construct the full likelihood function. For this simplified model, the likelihood is a product of Poisson probability mass functions over all bins:

    $L(\text{data} | \mu, \kappa_{t\bar{t}}) = \prod_{c \in \text{channels}} \prod_{i \in \text{bins}} \text{Pois}(N_{\text{obs}, c, i} | \lambda_{c, i}(\mu, \kappa_{t\bar{t}}))$

    Since the model in `utils/jax_stats.py` does not include systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters, there are no constraint terms in the likelihood.

2.  **Differentiable Hypothesis Test**: The main goal is to test for the presence of a signal. This is done using a profile likelihood ratio test statistic, $q_0$. `relaxed.infer.hypotest` performs this test. It finds the values of the model parameters (in this case, $\kappa_{t\bar{t}}$) that maximize the likelihood for a given $\mu$ (profiling) and then computes $q_0$. The significance is then $Z = \sqrt{q_0}$.

This means we can compute the gradient of the final significance `Z` with respect to any parameter in the chain, including the selection cut thresholds (`met_threshold`, etc.) and even the weights of a JAX-based MVA. This gradient is what drives the optimisation.

## Multi-Variate Analysis (MVA) Integration

The framework includes support for integrating Machine Learning models (MVAs) into the analysis, with implementations for both JAX and TensorFlow/Keras. This allows for the use of non-linear discriminants that can be pre-trained and, in the case of JAX models, optimized *in-situ* with the rest of the analysis.

The core logic is handled by the `JAXNetwork` and `TFNetwork` classes in `utils/mva.py`.

### MVA Implementations

#### `JAXNetwork`
This is a neural network implementation written purely in JAX, providing deep integration with the differentiable analysis workflow.
*   **Explicit Parameter Management**: Unlike frameworks that encapsulate model weights, the `JAXNetwork` manages its weights and biases in a simple Python dictionary. This transparency is key to its integration. Parameter names follow a convention (e.g., `__NN_my_model_W1`) that allows the framework to automatically identify them.
*   **End-to-End optimisation**: When MVA optimisation is enabled in the configuration (`grad_optimisation.optimise: True`), the network's parameters are added to the global set of variables that the main optimizer tunes. This means the optimizer can simultaneously adjust the MVA's weights to improve signal/background separation *and* tune the analysis selection cuts, all to directly maximize the final statistical significance.
*   **Full Control**: The from-scratch implementation gives full control over the network's forward pass, loss function, and training loop, all within the JAX ecosystem.
*   **Configuration**: The network architecture (layers, activations) is defined in `user/configuration.py`. Activations are provided as Python `lambda` functions, allowing for custom, non-standard activation functions if needed.

#### `TFNetwork`
This class provides a wrapper around a standard `tf.keras.Sequential` model.
*   **Leverage Keras**: It allows you to use the rich and mature Keras API for building and training models.
*   **Pre-training Only**: The primary use case is to pre-train a powerful discriminator. The trained model is then used to compute a score for each event, which is used as a static input feature in the main analysis. The weights of a TF/Keras model are **not** part of the global significance optimisation.
*   **Configuration**: The architecture is defined in the configuration file, with activations specified as strings (e.g., `"relu"`, `"tanh"`).

### The MVA Workflow: Pre-training and In-situ Optimisation

The framework handles MVAs in a two-stage process: an initial, one-off pre-training phase, followed by an optional, continuous optimisation phase that happens alongside the main analysis optimisation.

#### Stage 1: Pre-training

*   **When**: This happens once at the start of the analysis if `general.run_mva_training` is `True`.
*   **Data**: The framework allows for a completely separate object definition for MVA training. In `config.good_object_masks`, you can define an `mva` key with different object selection criteria than the `analysis` key. This is useful for training on a broader, less-biased dataset.
*   **Process**:
    1.  During event processing (`_prepare_data`), two parallel sets of object collections are created: one for the main analysis and one for MVA training, each with its own "good object" masks applied.
    2.  After all files are processed, the MVA-specific data is passed to `_run_mva_training`.
    3.  The models (both JAX and Keras) are trained on this dedicated dataset.
    4.  The resulting trained model (for Keras) or parameters (for JAX) are saved to disk.

#### Stage 2: Inference and In-situ Optimisation (Fine-tuning)

*   **When**: This happens at every step of the main gradient-based optimisation loop.
*   **Inference (On-the-fly)**:
    *   The MVA *instance* (containing the forward pass logic) and its input *features* are attached to a special collection in the event record.
    *   The differentiable selection function (e.g., `Zprime_softcuts_jax_workshop`) must be designed to accept this collection and the global `params` dictionary as inputs.
    *   Inside this traced function, the MVA's `forward_pass` is called on-the-fly, using the current state of the MVA's weights from the `params` dictionary. This ensures that the entire calculation, from MVA inputs to score, is part of the JAX computation graph.
*   **In-situ Optimisation (JAX only)**:
    *   If an MVA is configured with `framework: "jax"` and `grad_optimisation.optimise: True`, its pre-trained parameters are included in the set of globally optimisable parameters.
    *   Because the MVA's forward pass is executed on-the-fly within the main traced function, its output (the MVA score) is fully differentiable with respect to its weights and biases.
    *   The gradient of the final statistical significance is therefore also calculated with respect to these MVA parameters.
    *   The `optax` optimiser updates the MVA weights at each step, effectively "fine-tuning" the MVA to directly maximise the analysis significance, alongside all other selection cuts.
    *   Keras models are used for inference only; their weights are not optimised during this stage.

### Extending and Adding a New MVA

Adding a new MVA to the analysis is a configuration-driven process:

1.  **Add to Config**: Create a new dictionary entry in the `mva` list in `user/configuration.py`. Give it a unique `name`.

2.  **Define Architecture & Framework**:
    *   Set `framework` to `"jax"` or `"keras"`.
    *   Define the `layers` list, specifying the dimensions, activation functions, and names for weights/biases for each layer.
    *   Define the `loss` function.

3.  **Define Input Features**:
    *   In the `features` list for your MVA, define each input variable.
    *   Each feature needs a `name`, a `function` to compute it (e.g., `lambda mva: mva.n_jet`), and a `use` key specifying the inputs to that function. The framework automatically computes "ghost observables" first, so you can define features that depend on them.

4.  **Use the MVA in Selection**:
    *   The framework will automatically train the MVA (if `run_mva_training` is `True`) and compute its output score for every event.
    *   This score is attached to a special object collection named after your MVA (e.g., `wjets_vs_ttbar_nn`).
    *   You can then use this score in your differentiable selection function in `user/cuts.py` just like any other variable.

5.  **Enable Gradient optimisation (JAX only)**:
    *   To make the JAX MVA's weights optimizable, set `grad_optimisation.optimise: True` in its configuration.
    *   The framework will automatically find all parameters with the `__NN` prefix and add them to the set of variables that the optimizer will tune. You can even set a custom learning rate for the MVA weights.

## Extending the Analysis

#### Adding a New Optimizable Parameter

1.  **Add to Config**: Add a new key-value pair to `config["jax"]["params"]`.
    ```python
    "params": {
        'met_threshold': 50.0,
        'btag_threshold': 0.5,
        'my_new_cut': 100.0, # <-- Add new parameter
    },
    ```
2.  **Use in Soft Selection**: Use `params["my_new_cut"]` in your soft selection function in `user/cuts.py`.
3.  **(Optional) Add a Clamp**: Add a rule for your new parameter in `config["jax"]["param_updates"]` to keep it within a sensible range.

#### Adding a New Systematic Uncertainty

1.  **Add to Config**: Add a new dictionary to the `config["systematics"]` list.
2.  **Define Logic**:
    *   If it's a simple scale factor, you can define the `up_function` and `down_function` directly in the config (e.g., `lambda: 1.05`).
    *   For more complex variations, define a function in `user/systematics.py` that takes an object collection and returns a per-object weight.
    *   For `correctionlib`-based uncertainties, ensure the `file` and `key` are specified correctly.
3.  **Specify Target**: Define the `target` (which object and variable are affected) and the `op` (how the variation is applied, e.g., `mult` or `add`).

The framework will automatically propagate these systematics through the non-differentiable analysis path to produce varied histograms for tools like `cabinetry`.

## Non-Differentiable Analysis

Alongside the differentiable path, the framework fully supports a traditional, non-differentiable analysis via the `NonDiffAnalysis` class in `analysis/nondiff.py`. This path uses standard hard cuts and fills `hist` objects, which can then be used with tools like `cabinetry` for statistical inference. You can control which analysis runs via the `analysis` key in `config.general`.

### Output Directory Structure

The framework now uses a **centralised output directory management system** that organises all outputs under a single root directory specified by `general.output_dir`. The default structure is:

```
output/                      # Root output directory (configurable via general.output_dir)
├── cache/                   # Temporary files and gradients cache
├── metadata/                # JSON metadata files (fileset.json, workitems.json, etc.)
├── skimmed/                 # Skimmed ROOT files organised by dataset
│   ├── {dataset}/
│   │   └── file__{idx}/
│   │       └── part_{chunk}.root
├── plots/                   # All visualisation outputs
│   ├── features/            # Feature distribution plots
│   ├── scores/              # MVA score plots
│   ├── optimisation/        # Parameter optimisation plots
│   └── fit/                 # Statistical fit plots
├── models/                  # Trained MVA models (.pkl files)
├── histograms/              # Analysis histograms (.root and .pkl files)
└── statistics/              # Statistical analysis results
```

#### Flexible Directory Configuration

You can customise where the framework looks for metadata and skimmed files:

```python
# Use default structure under output_dir
general_config = {
    "output_dir": "my_analysis_outputs/",
}

# Or specify existing directories to read from
general_config = {
    "output_dir": "my_analysis_outputs/",
    "metadata_dir": "/shared/existing/metadata/",  # Read metadata from here
    "skimmed_dir": "/shared/existing/skimmed/",    # Read skimmed files from here
}
```

**Fallback Logic:**
- If `metadata_dir` is specified, the framework reads metadata from that location
- If not specified, it looks under `output_dir/metadata/`
- If neither exists and metadata is needed, the framework will error with a helpful message
- Same logic applies to `skimmed_dir` and `output_dir/skimmed/`

This design allows you to:
- **Share preprocessed data** between analyses by pointing to existing directories
- **Keep outputs organised** in a predictable structure
- **Easily find results** in one centralised location

### Key Design Principle

The framework separates **user-configurable modules** (`user/`) from **framework code** (`analysis/`, `utils/`):

- **`user/` directory**: Contains modules that users should modify for their specific analysis needs
- **`analysis/` and `utils/` directories**: Contains framework code that provides the analysis infrastructure

This separation ensures that users can focus on physics configuration while the framework handles the technical implementation details.

## Logical Flow of the Differentiable Analysis

Understanding the logical flow of the differentiable analysis helps users see how their configuration choices in the `user/` directory affect the overall workflow. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Initialization and Configuration Loading
```
user/configuration.py → Analysis Setup
```
- The analysis starts by loading your configuration from `user/configuration.py`
- This defines all analysis parameters, observables, cuts, and optimization settings
- The framework validates the configuration against the schema in `utils/schema.py`

### 2. Data Preprocessing (One-time Setup)
```
Raw NanoAOD → Preprocessing → Cached Data
```
- If `general.run_preprocessing=True`, raw NanoAOD files are skimmed
- Only branches specified in `config.preprocess.branches` are kept
- Baseline selections from `config.baseline_selection` are applied
- Results are cached for faster subsequent runs

### 3. MVA Pre-training (Optional)
```
Cached Data → Feature Extraction → Model Training → Saved Model
```
- If `general.run_mva_training=True`, neural networks are pre-trained
- Features defined in `config.mva[].features` are computed using functions from `user/observables.py`
- Models are trained to distinguish between background processes
- Trained parameters are saved and later used in the main analysis

### 4. Event Processing Loop
```
For each event batch:
  Raw Objects → Corrections → Good Objects → Ghost Observables
```
- Object corrections from `config.corrections` are applied
- "Good object" masks from `config.good_object_masks` filter objects
- "Ghost observables" from `config.ghost_observables` are computed using `user/observables.py`
- This creates an event records with all necessary variables

### 5. Differentiable Selection (The Core Loop)
```
For each optimization step:
  Events → Soft Cuts → Event Weights → Histograms → Significance → Gradients → Parameter Updates
```
- **Soft Cuts**: Your selection function from `user/cuts.py` (e.g., `Zprime_softcuts_jax_workshop`) is called
- **Event Weights**: Instead of hard cuts, sigmoid functions produce continuous weights (0-1) per event
- **Histograms**: Events are binned using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) - smooth and differentiable
- **Significance**: Statistical model computes discovery significance using the `relaxed` library
- **Gradients**: JAX computes gradients of significance w.r.t. all parameters in `config.jax.params`
- **Updates**: Optimiser (optax) updates parameters to maximise significance

### 6. Parameter Flow Through the System
```
config.jax.params → Selection Function → Event Weights → Final Significance
     ↑                                                           ↓
Parameter Updates ←← Gradients ←← Statistical Model ←← Histograms
```
- Parameters you define in `config.jax.params` (e.g., `met_threshold: 50.0`) flow into your selection function
- Your selection function in `user/cuts.py` uses these parameters in sigmoid cuts
- The resulting event weights affect histogram shapes
- Changes in histograms affect the final statistical significance
- Gradients flow backward through this entire chain to update parameters

### 7. Multi-Channel Analysis
```
For each channel in config.channels:
  Selection → Observable Computation → Histogramming → Statistical Combination
```
- Each analysis channel (signal region, control regions) is processed
- Channel-specific selections from `config.channels[].selection` are applied
- Observables from `config.channels[].observables` are computed using `user/observables.py`
- All channels contribute to the final statistical model


### Key Insight: Your Role as a User
- **Configuration (`user/configuration.py`)**: You define what gets optimized and how
- **Observables (`user/observables.py`)**: You define what physics quantities to compute
- **Cuts (`user/cuts.py`)**: You define how events are selected (both hard and soft cuts)
- **Systematics (`user/systematics.py`)**: You define uncertainty sources

The framework handles the technical details (JAX tracing, gradient computation, optimisation) while you focus on the physics logic. Every function you write in the `user/` directory becomes part of a fully differentiable computation graph that can be optimised end-to-end.
